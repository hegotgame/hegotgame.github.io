    Option A: "Tracing Environmental Geographies"
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <ol>
      <li>I was impressed with how the local shop owners got together and decided they voluntarily would not use plastic bags. This had a profound effect in reducing and eliminating plastic bag use and made a lasting environmentalimpact by leading by example as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter" alt="Early Adopter or Lighthouse Customer">lighthouse customer</a> of environmental stewardship.</li>
      <li>One specific example of how the locals solved this problem was they readily found alternatives like paper bags for produce!  This was a counterexample to the history of the "paper or plastic" consumer choice that was given. </li>
      <li><p>I think a combination of global and local scales are needed to confront the problem. I was most disheartened when the manufacturer suggested, <q cite="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZKUawoG9qk&t=41m51s">all the attributes of my (the bag's) permanence work to the advantage of the environment and not against the environment.</q>  'Permanence,' I believe, is the most eerie part of this statement, and there are certainly many sea turtles that disagree! </p>
      <img src="https://cleanmalaysia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/plasticbag-790x444.jpg" alt="sea turtle">
      <p>On the local scale, there can be cultural shifts like the woman who approached the shopkeepers to voluntarily eliminate plastic bags.  This can lead to city bans like in San Francisco or Leaf Rapids, Manitoba.  On the global scale, supply chains can be reconstructed as multinational corporations have to confront large consumer markets like India <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/single-use-plastic-ban-india_us_5b3a09b6e4b0f3c221a28a07">which is planning to ban the bag in 2022</a>.  This regulation would force suppliers to use different materials and re-purpose the 4% of petroleum resources for something else (or not use it at all, which is unlikely).</p>   </li>
      <li>see links and turtle above<br></li>

      <li><b>TRUE STORY:</b>I was once fired for refusing to throw away a plastic grocery store bag.  I took my employer to court, and I won. I was awarded several thousands of dollars.  I won't blather on in-keeping with the spirit of this course, but I guess I learned that America is a great country where untoward ethics can be defeated.</li>
