    <p>Oh, wow, was I hungry.  It was a long night of working and I was by myself in the quality lab, alone and hungry.  Many long hours worked and no time to run up to the break room to get the traditional cafeteria meal and no time today to pack my lunch.</p>
    <p>I made a hodgepodge of items from we were producing at work.  After all, there is always a little bit left over from the quality tests.  Here we go, this is the smorgasboard I made for myself:</p>

    Well, this was the only product we don't make in the plant I work at, but there was a small stash of chips in the lab for sampling the product in action.

    Next, it was time to cover the chips in chili and cheese.  The cheese wasn't cheddar, though we make that also.  The cheese I used is shown below.

    Yum, yum, yum.  Delicious Queso cheese covered the chips with the must-have complement of chili.

    Next, the stand alone product of bannana pudding of the finest quality functioned as a great dessert item.  Even when you have been to a fancy restaurant and they ask you for your desert order, isn't a bannana pudding a great choice?

    For the surpise choice of beverage, I reached for a chocolate milk like product, but it is also a nutritional drink.

    Now, it all gets topped off with a shot of coffee creamer.  Oh is it so sweet.  It's like a sugary rush of flavor.<br>

    <p>So why did I choose this particular meal?  Since I know how the food is produced and made, I just might have an excellent starting point to investigate just how exactly the ingredients get mixed together and so on.  I think I will learn much more than I know now about how the food gets to my work bench and the waste product and packaging that is part of the process.  One key individual was not wasted in this process, I really enjoyed the meal.  It may seem like an odd combination, but it really went well together and I was satisfied.  I'm just another satisfied customer in the supply chain!</p>
