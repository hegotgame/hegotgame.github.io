    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    I work for a local food manufacturer.  We have many food and beverage products.  Despite working with the materials in a hands-on manner, in writing up this post, I realized I am only a small cog in the machine in producing the product shown above!  My company batches some raw materials, bottles the batch up, and labels the bottles.  We are not the first or last touchpoint in the supply chain, and I realized so much work and materials go into any product we produce. 
    
    What environmental impacts were associated with the production of your meal or item?
    One specific environmental impact I can speak on is that the plant I work in is on the TRI (Toxic Release Inventory) list we reviewed in class.  My plant uses numerous hazardous chemicals (mostly extremely strong acids and bases).  The primary reasons we need to do this involves the rigorous cleaning and sanitizing standards we implement in production and the chemicals are needed to clean and sanitize our equipment depending on time, conditions, and circumstances.
    There are many impacts associated with such responsibility associated with hazardous chemicals.  These impacts include handling, labeling, worker safety, disposal, release, and chemical mixing hazards.  For example, I’ve only worked for this company for under a year, but I heard about a significant event that had direct environmental impact on the local community.  You can read about it <a href="https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/hundreds-evacuated-after-chemical-spill-at-gehl-foods-plant-in-germantown"> here</a>.  (This information would be hard to come by through just Googling the product ingredients list!)
    
     
    
    (a) Determine and describe, in as much detail as you can, where at least two ingredients of your meal OR components of your consumer item were produced. (You can do more if you are so inspired.) 
    Two ingredients I want to focus on are water and ascorbic acid.  Water is the one ingredient that I am personally reasonable for adding and, yes, it is the ingredient with the highest quantity!  We have two “types” of water we add, depending on customer requirements.  We either add well water from underground Germantown or deionized water from our water silo.  I am not sure if the DI water is filled up by an outside vendor or produced on site, but either possibility is within our capabilities.  The well water is supposedly a famous property of Wisconsin water as being tasty (or maybe I’m just buying into the hype train, but I can say from personal experience that the water is very good)!  I don’t deal directly with any of the other ingredients, but I know that the ascorbic acid sometimes must be adjusted if the product formula needs to be tweaked to match customer requirements.  Again, this is another hazardous chemical that needs to be handled, but at least it is a relatively weak acid.
     
    
    Next, describe the environmental impacts associated with the production of these ingredients or components (or likely impacts, if you can’t trace the actual impacts), by answering the following questions:
    
     
    
    (b) How did your product affect resources like water (groundwater or surface water – did its production deplete or pollute them?), soil, and ecosystems (for instance, did its production reduce biodiversity or habitat)?
    Sometimes we run out of water!  DI water, that is.  Well water is being pumped out in large quantities, we have several water meters to draw from, each meter is capable of drawing approximately 3600 gallons of water per hour!  I did a “Climate Change Hackathon” earlier this week and I learned that the average American uses 82 gallons of water in a day.  Well, I guess I’m not that average when I draw from the well!  This water doesn’t <i>all</i> go into my stomach and it actually gets distributed all over the world.  Some of our products are very popular in the Middle East, for example.  So yes, I pump the water out of the well and it might go into a cheese or beverage that gets eaten in Dubai!  We may be depleting the water supply, but I would need to do further analysis to sustain that claim as there are natural cycles that replace some of what we draw out.  I also monitor the pH as we add water to our products and the changing pH components eventually get released to the environment, which could possibly alter ecosystems if not done in a safe way.
    
     
    
    (c) Were chemicals or fossil fuels used to produce your meal or item? Which ones? If so, what environmental effects did they have?
    
     
    
    (d) How, if at all, did the production of your meal or item contribute to carbon dioxide emissions—and thus potentially to climate change? How, if at all, did it affect air quality?
    
     
    
    (e) In what ways are these impacts “local”? Do some places bear more of the environmental impacts of your meal than others? In what ways are they “global”?
    
     
    
    (2) What environmental impacts were associated with the transportation, distribution, and consumption of the ingredients or materials you’ve chosen? Describe the environmental impacts associated with the distribution and transportation of these ingredients or materials, by answering the following questions:
    
     
    
    (a) How did the meal or product get to you? Did it reach you by airplane? By truck? By wheelbarrow? Did you buy them at a supermarket? A farmer’s market? A restaurant? A corner store? A “big box” store? Etc.
    
     
    
    (b) Which ingredient or part of your product traveled the furthest to get to you? Which ingredients or components, if any, would you consider “local,” and why?
    
     
    
    (c) What kind of waste did your meal or item produce? (Consider packaging, food waste, etc.) Where will this waste go, and what will its environmental impacts include?
    
     
    
    (3) For creativity/effectiveness: Please include at least one of the following, either embedded within your post, or through a link to an external web resource:
    
     
    
    -          a relevant map (for instance, a map showing the regions of Wisconsin, US, or the world where an ingredient or material is produced)
    
     
    
    -          a relevant image (photo, etc.) or graphic (diagram, table, etc.) depicting impacts of production or transportation of your ingredient or material, in a place
