    Is my product (pictured above) an environmental ‘problem’ or a ‘solution’?  I don’t believe in this dichotomy.  My product is both, but I preach the philosophy of ‘good’ and ‘opportunities’ as in opportunities for improvement.  Perhaps, as we look to the future, this product is destined for innovation and improvement to turn the opportunities for improvement into more sustainable business and environmental practices.

    The good has to start with the number one ingredient:  water.  Water is a friendly chemical that we all must consume every day and it even makes up about 60% of the human body.  As we studied in class, water sources can be depleted when the water balance sheet is not considered.  At my workplace we use large quantities of water that may dent into the local supply (this is difficult to say if this is a ‘problem’ until a quantifiable study can be done – but it is possible there may be an opportunity for improvement to manage the water supply appropriately.)  If the water supply is being overdrawn, alternative sources of water should be considered.

    One possible innovation would be transforming the product into a powder form that could be consumed with “just add water.”  This would push water production to the source of consumption and would also depend on consumers having access to clean and potable tap water.  This would also save transportation costs (and the environmental cost of water weight being physically transported with semi-trucks and gasoline powered vehicles).

    In its current form, the packaging choices offer numerous opportunities for households (at the household scale) to participate in recycling.  The bottles are made from polypropylene (recycling number 5).  Furthermore, recycling of the cardboard exterior is possible as well.

    Perhaps the most surprising part of this blog project was the extra thinking I had to do about working in a TRI facility.  Working with dangerous chemicals to produce food means there are opportunities for safety enhancements for workers and environmental safety enhancements for local population and local ecosystems.  For example, I was looking at the SPS for sulfuric acid, which we use in the lab for testing, and I noticed the different ecotoxicity labeling.  If the acid is disposed of properly, the local fish population will be thankful the company was an environmental steward and not a malevolent actor!  Thus, food companies and fish populations (as an example) need to achieve symbiosis whether through regulation, education, or economic incentives.  Furthermore, this adds value to the consumer of the product itself as many costumers are becoming wise and like to know the money they spend on food is spent in a responsible way for the environment!
